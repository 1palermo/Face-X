EfficientNetB2 is an earlier variety of Eff-nets.
Though it has upgraded version it is very good and optimized model to train images.

## Summary :
### Dataset : 
#### Link of the dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/jonathanoheix/face-expression-recognition-dataset
#### Data Type : Image Data

 ## PS : 
 In this project you have to connect the system to GPU . 
 **Nevertheless if you connect it to your local gpu or cloud gpu it would 
 still take minimum of 2.5 hours to complete just 3 epochs. So running this notebook 
 may take a large time to fit on 10 epochs which can produce a promisable accuracy over the dataset**.
 
 
 ## Goal of the project :
 Goal of this project is to learn to use efficientnet.
 We can tune downgraded versions or upgraded versions of Eff-Net similarly.
