# FaceX - Recognition using Inception ResNet-V2

## Overview

- Uses the original from-scratch implementation as given by [Szegedy et. al.] (https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07261v2)
- Implemented in PyTorch

## Note to users

- You can download required packages using the requirements.txt present by running the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- The model is not trained, but the subroutines are completely prepared to handle all contingencies and pre-trained weights in a .pkl format from `torchscript` or otherwise. 
- If you have the resources, please feel free to take up the training of the model.
- More details about the implementation, and all other such details can be found in the notebook itself.
