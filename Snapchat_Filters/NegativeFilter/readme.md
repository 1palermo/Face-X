Inverting a digital image is a point processing operation.

The output of image inversion is a negative of a digital image.

In a digital image the intensity levels vary from 0 to L-1. The negative transformation is given by s=L-1-r.

When an image is inverted, each of its pixel value ‘r’ is subtracted from the maximum pixel value L-1 and the original pixel is replaced with the result ‘s’.

Image inversion or Image negation helps finding the details from the darker regions of the image.

The negative transformation has its applications in the areas of Medical Imaging, Remote Sensing and others.
