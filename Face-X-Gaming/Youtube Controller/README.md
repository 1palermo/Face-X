# Youtube Video Controller 
A youtube video controller made using opencv and pyautogui to navigate through video using hand gestures
This is a real-time controller for youtube

This is a Python script for a real-time video-based wink detector. It uses the OpenCV library to detect faces and eyes, and the PyAutoGUI library to simulate a key press when a wink is detected (in this case, the space bar).
The program continuously captures frames from the default video camera and processes each frame to detect winks. If a single wink is detected, the program simulates a key press. The program stops when the user presses 'q' on the keyboard.
